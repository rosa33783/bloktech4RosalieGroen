The MIT License is a permissive open-source license widely used for software projects. It allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell copies of the software, subject to certain conditions.

Here's some background information about the MIT License and how to use it:

Permission: The license grants permission to any person obtaining a copy of the software to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software.

Conditions: The license does not impose many restrictions, but it requires that the original copyright notice and the permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

Warranty: The license states that the software is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from the use or distribution of the software.

To use the MIT License for your software project, you should include the license text at the beginning of the source code files or in a separate license file. You can replace "Blok Tech" with your own name or the name of your organization.

It's important to note that while the MIT License allows for great freedom in using and modifying the software, it also means that there is no obligation for users to contribute back changes to the original project. If you're interested in ensuring contributions are shared back with the community, you may consider other licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL) or Apache License.
