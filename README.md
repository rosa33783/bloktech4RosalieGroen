If you are thinking about building a matching application here are some things you van use to make a good start.

**NPM**
First you have to install NPM on your VS code.
npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. It helps developers easily manage and install packages and dependencies for their projects. npm provides a command-line interface (CLI) and a central package registry, making it simple to find, install, and update packages. It also facilitates dependency management, versioning, and the execution of custom script.

**Handlebars**
I used handlebars to render my html pages via one template.
Handlebars is a popular templating language that allows you to generate dynamic HTML templates by combining static HTML markup with dynamic data. It provides a straightforward and intuitive syntax for rendering data dynamically within HTML templates.

**MongoDB**
I used MongoDB to store the accounts and show them on my matched.handlebars page.
MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database management system that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB follows a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents.

**Mongoose**
For my application I used Mongoose to get the data from the database.
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that provides a simplified way to interact with MongoDB. It acts as a middleware layer between your application and the MongoDB database, allowing you to define schemas, models, and perform database operations easily.

**Linters**
ESLint is a popular linter for JavaScript and TypeScript code. A linter is a tool that analyzes your code for potential errors, style violations, and other issues, helping you catch and fix problems early in the development process. ESLint is highly configurable, which means you can customize its rules to match your coding style and project requirements. I highly reccomend to install this.

# .env
With the database its also really important to use an .env file in your code so you can put your 
database URI in there so nobody can see your password and account name.


# license
The MIT License is a permissive open-source license widely used for software projects. It allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and sell copies of the software, subject to certain conditions.

Here's some background information about the MIT License and how to use it:

Permission: The license grants permission to any person obtaining a copy of the software to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software.

Conditions: The license does not impose many restrictions, but it requires that the original copyright notice and the permission notice be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

Warranty: The license states that the software is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from the use or distribution of the software.

To use the MIT License for your software project, you should include the license text at the beginning of the source code files or in a separate license file. You can replace "Blok Tech" with your own name or the name of your organization.

It's important to note that while the MIT License allows for great freedom in using and modifying the software, it also means that there is no obligation for users to contribute back changes to the original project. If you're interested in ensuring contributions are shared back with the community, you may consider other licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL) or Apache License.
